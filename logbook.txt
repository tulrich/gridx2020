Comparison with Sepulveda 2018

Theirs:

  * written by experts, peer reviewed

  * 1 year of hourly data (same)

  * their northern system is similar to (same as?) mine (ISO-NE)

  * their dispatch model is much more sophisticated (minimum ramping
    rates of thermal sources, etc). My contention is this doesn't
    really doesn't matter (physically) to any scenario with
    significant batteries on the grid.

  * Runs optimization across sweeps of several variables: CO2, tech costs.

  * They're not really modeling "full decarbonization", ascribing zero
    CO2 to low-carbon resources. Results below 50g/KWh (where the
    scenarios diverge) aren't very meaningful, IMO.

  * Models one year. Optimizes. No build time.

Mine:

  * ----> Explicitly models the transition.

  * Newer numbers and modeled learning rates. (E.g. their midrange
    solar/wind/batt price corresponds approx to today's observed
    values.)
